# Indoor-Gardening
Indoor Gardening system using Arduino based circuit for automation use.
* The principle of this machine is to take care of the garden inside the automation system,using modules connected to the Arduino Uno to assure the maximum 
performance of the system.
* Additional feature of this machine is to use both a remote and a application on the android platform through a wireless connection to execute commands to the Arduino Board,the remote being used in home instead, and the application built on Android to be used outside home using a Wi Fi Module connected to the internet to a Server-Based Web Client whenever the host needs it.
Components of the automation system are:
* Liquid-Crystal Display(Shows the Humidity of the soil,current variable temperature in time(Celsius),the status of the circuit(IF ON OR OFF),When entered in manual mode(Shows MANUAL on display,The speed of the FAN and Water Storage Level)
* Water level sensor - for detecting water level inside the W. storage
* Humidity sensor - for detecting soil Humidity and when detected low level of humidity powers on the pump and when the sensor detects a suitable humidity for the plant.
* 2 Status LEDs - Green and Red (When the water goes on low level,the RED led will blink because no water is in the water storage.Green will show the status of the circuit if it s ON,and when the manual button is pressed on the remote or android app,the LEDs will be on constantly showing that it s entered in MANUAL MODE.)
* Cooling FAN - for assuring fresh air for the plant inside the housing.
* Additional Battery for powering on the whole circuit(12 V)
* LED Bands for decoration.
* SD CARD Module for retrieving additional information.
* Buzzer for semnaling that the circuit is on when turned on from the app or remote(2 beeps every 0.5 milisecond for ON;1 beep(0.5 ms for OFF))
** IR Sensor for detecting the speed of the FAN.
